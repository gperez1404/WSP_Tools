
# This script calculates the Average Slope of a Catchment to use in DRAINS

# The slope of a catchment in percent can be calculated as:

# SlopeÂ (%) = [ (Î”H)/ L ] Ã— 100

# where:

# Î”H is the change in elevation across the catchment (usually the difference 
# between the maximum and minimum elevations).

# L is the flow path length or the distance over which the elevation change occurs 
# (typically the length of the main river or flow path within the catchment).

# This can be calculated by calcualting the slope of the DEM raster within 
# the catchment boundaries 
# using the Spatial Analyst tools available in GIS software like QGIS or ArcGIS.

# Slope is often represented in Percentage (%) and Degrees

# The Slope in  Degrees calculated using trigonometric functions based on elevation 
# differences and distances.

# Common Range of Values for "Sub Catchment Slope (%)"
# For sub-catchments, slope values generally range from very flat (close to 0%) 
# in plains and flat areas to steep (30% or higher) in mountainous regions. 
# For river catchments, slopes are usually between 0.1% and 15%.
